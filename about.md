## About Craig Balding

<img src="/images/craig.png" alt="Craig Balding" width="380">

Hi there. I’m Craig Balding and this website is where I write about what I'm building.

I live in Budapest with my wife and 3 daughters.  I run my own business focused on cybersecurity.  Prior to this I held senior leadership positions at Barclays PLC and General Electric.

Even with 3 decades of active, hands-on experience in technology, I don’t claim to have all the answers and every day discover new things to learn.  I’m happy to share what I learn along the way here.
