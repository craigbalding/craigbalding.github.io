As I build things to sell, I will list them here.  The list is currently sparse, I'd better get on with it!@

# Services

* [CyberSecurity Consulting](https://www.resilientsecurity.co.uk/)

# Products

TBD

# Courses

Any micro courses I develop for sale will be listed here.  These will include:

* Behind-the-scenes recordings showing the nuts and bolts of how to get a task down
* Regular exercises and actionable lessons. 
* The key 20% of information responsible for 80% of results (it's a micro course so better be focused!)
* Templates, checklists or other reusable artefacts to help with getting started and repeatibility.

*Iâ€™ve deep experience with Cyber Security and have helped hundreds of organisations improve their cyber capability.  In other areas my experience does not run deep and I do not claim any particular expertise.  Rather, I tend to quickly get what I need to know from people one or two steps ahead of me and then build on that if needed.
