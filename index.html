<h1>Hi, I'm Craig!</h1>

<p>After two decades in the corporate world, I started a cybersecurity consulting business to help people in a wide range of organisations improve their cyber risk and security capabilities.  5 years in and I still enjoy helping decision makers rethink cyber risk, improve strategy and policy.  A material amount of my work is hands-on, which keeps me fresh on both attack and defence.</p>

<p>The next phase in my evolution is product and service creation.  The goal is to make things that people are willing to pay for as they solve real problems.  Naturally, I have many ideas in the cybersecurity domain, but also plan to diversify as curiousity and market needs lead me.</p>

<p>This blog will record the behind the scenes journey.   Over time, it will become the portfolio of my creations.</p>

<p>Currently working on: <a href="https://sb2.uk">sb2 - the Small Business Security Bot</a></p>
